Accelerometers

Accelerometers are one of the highest volume MEMS products: The annual
worldwide sales are more than 100 million units and are growing steadily. His-
torically, the automotive industry has been the growth driver. Today, all cars
employ at least high-G crash sensors for air bag deployment. In addition, low-G
sensors are used for active suspensions and vehicle stabilization controls. More
recently, as the accelerometer prices have dropped to a dollar range, consumer
applications have become economically feasible. For example, the latest genera-
tion of game consoles contains accelerometers for measuring the game controller
movement to enable motion based user interface. Recently, cell phones enhanced
with a motion based user interface have also become available. Accelerometers
are also used by runners to determine the running speed and in digital cameras
to determine the picture orientation. Some laptop hard drives utilize accelerom-
eter based “free fall” detection to protect the hard drive from impacts. With the
decreasing price, the number of accelerometer applications is going to increase
in the coming years.

In this book, the accelerometers will be used to illustrate the microsensing
techniques presented in later chapters. Chapter 4 covers the design of microme-
chanical springs used for the construction of microsensors. The piezoresistive
and capacitive sensing principles are covered in detail in Chapters 5 and 6,
respectively, and piezoelectric sensing is analyzed in Chapter 7. The interface
electronics and the associated noise is covered in Chapter 8 and Chapter 9,
respectively. Low switched capacitor circuits suitable for capacitive accelerom-
eters are introduced in Chapter 10.

This chapter focuses on the fundamental principles of acceleration sensing.
First, we will analyze the mechanical response of accelerometers. The response
function is derived and studied in the frequency and time domain. After analyz-

ing the eﬀect of damping and resonant frequency on the accelerometer response,
we will cover the fundamental mechanical noise limitations. The chapter is con-
cluded with case studies on surface and bulk micromachined accelerometers.

3.1 Operation principle

The accelerometer structure is illustrated in Figure 3.1. A proof mass m is
connected to the frame by a ﬂexible spring k. Due to the mass inertia, the
proof mass motion will lag the frame motion. To prevent excessive ringing, the
vibrations are damped by introducing gas (or liquid such as oil in macroscopic
sensors) inside the package. This damping is represented with a dashpot γ.

Figure 3.1: The basic structure of an accelerometer consists of a proof mass m that
is suspended with a spring k to a frame. Due to inertia of the proof mass, the motion
of the mass does not follow the frame motion and the diﬀerence in displacement x =
xf − xm can be used to measure the acceleration. Also provided is the noise-equivalent
acceleration (due to mechanical Brownian noise).

The accelerometers can either be single axis or they can measure accel-
eration in multiple directions. In principle, a three axis accelerometer can be
based on a single proof mass that can move in X-, Y -, and Z-directions. By
measuring the mass displacement in all three directions, the acceleration can
be deduced. Most practical sensors, however, measure the mass displacement
along just one or two directions and multiple independent masses are used for
three axis accelerometers [27].

The following sensing principles are used for micromechanical accelerome-

ters [28]:
Piezoresistive sensing is based on piezoresistors integrated onto the spring.
The piezoresistor resistance changes when subjected to the acceleration
induced stress. Thus, by measuring the resistance change, the acceleration
is deduced. The ﬁrst micromachined silicon accelerometers developed in
the 70’s were based on piezoresistive sensing [29]. The piezoresistive sens-
ing is robust and simple to implement but has poor noise and power
performance. The piezoresistive sensing is covered in Chapter 5.

Capacitive sensing is based on detecting small change in capacitance due to
relative movement of the proof mass and the frame. The capacitive ac-
celerometers are currently the most widely used accelerometers as they are
inexpensive, have good noise performance, and low power consumption.
The capacitive sensing is covered in Chapter 6.

Piezoelectric sensing is based on a charge polarization of piezoelectric ma-
terials due to the strain caused by the inertial force. In the simplest con-
ﬁguration, the proof mass is attached to a piezoelectric plate that acts as
a spring. The piezoelectric plate generates current that is proportional to
the change in acceleration. As the sensor generates the current, the sen-
sor is called self-generating. The drawback of piezoelectric sensors is that
the sensor only measures the changes in acceleration and cannot be used
to measure dc-acceleration. The piezoelectric sensing is commonly used
for macroscopic sensors but is rarely used for microscopic accelerometers.
The piezoelectric sensing is covered in Chapter 7.

In addition to the above sensing principles, optical and magnetic position de-
tection have been used for macroscopic sensors [28], but these methods are not
practical for microsensors.

3.2 Accelerometer equation

To analyze the accelerometer in Figure 3.1, we start with the equation of motion
for the proof mass given by

m

∂2xm
∂t2 + γ

∂(xm − xf )

∂t

+ k(xm − xf ) = FE,

(3.1)

where xm and xf are the positions of the mass and frame, respectively, and
FE is the external force acting on the mass for example due to actuation or
Brownian noise. Equation (3.1) can be simpliﬁed by subtracting m ∂2xf
from
∂t2
both sides leading to
∂2(xm − xf )

(3.2)
Recognizing that x = xf − xm is the diﬀerence of the frame and mass positions
leads to the familiar one degree-of-freedom damped resonator governed by

+ k(xm − xf ) = −m

∂2xf
∂t2 + Fe.

where F is the sum of inertial and external forces F = m ∂2xf

(3.4)

where we have assumed that there are no external forces (FE = 0).

The frequency responses H(s) for a critically damped accelerometer (Q =
0.5) as a function of the resonance frequency ω0 are plotted in Figure 3.2. The
low frequency response increases with the decreasing resonance frequency ω0
and the high frequency displacement is seen as independent of the resonance
frequency. Thus, reducing the resonant frequency increases the sensitivity but
decreases −3 dB bandwidth.

Figure 3.2: The frequency responses x/¨x ≡ H(s) for a critically damped accelerometer
(Q = 0.5).

3.2.1 Low-frequency response

The low-frequency response describes the accelerometer operation below its me-
chanical resonant frequency. Most MEMS sensors operate in this region with the
typical resonant frequencies in the 10 Hz to 10 kHz range. From Equation (3.4),
the low frequency response to acceleration ¨x is

x ≈ m¨xf /k = ¨xf /ω2

0

for ω (cid:28) ω0.

(3.5)

Equation (3.5) depends only on the resonance frequency suggesting that ac-
celerometer size can be scaled without aﬀecting the mechanical performance if
the proof mass and spring constant are reduced proportionally. However, as was
shown in Chapter 2, the mechanical vibrations due to thermal noise increase
with decreasing mass size. As a result, large masses are desired for low noise
sensors. The mechanical noise in accelerometers is further studied in Section 3.4.

Example 3.1: Accelerometer displacement
Problem: A capacitive accelerometer is to have a displacement of 0.5 µm at
2 G acceleration. Calculate the sensor resonant frequency.
Solution: From Equation (3.5) we obtain the resonant frequency as

2 · 9.81 m/s2

0.5 µm

= 1.0 kHz.

3.2.2 High-frequency response

Equation (3.5) shows that to obtain a sensitive accelerometer, the resonant
frequency should be as low as possible. Taken to the extreme, the resonant
frequency may be 1 Hz or lower and the sensor is operated above the natural
frequency (ω (cid:29) ω0). These types of sensors are used as seismometers to measure
the ground vibrations and earth quakes.
Substituting ¨xf = s2xf into Equation (3.4) and taking limit ω (cid:29) ω0 leads

to

x ≈ xf

for ω (cid:29) ω0.

(3.6)

The physical interpretation of Equation (3.6) is that at above resonance fre-
quency, the proof mass essentially stays immobile and the diﬀerence of the
mass and frame positions is simply x = xf − xm ≈ xf .

The mechanical resonance frequency of less than 1 Hz is obtainable with
macroscopic devices that have large mass but is not easily achieved with small
MEMS components. For this reason, the commercial MEMS accelerometers
operate below the resonance frequency.

Example 3.2: A “MEMS seismometer” mass
Problem: A practical lower limit for a MEMS spring constant is around k =
1 N/m. Calculate the required proof mass dimensions to evaluate the feasibility
of scaling down a macroscopic seismometer design with a resonant frequency of
f0 = 0.2 Hz.
Solution: With a spring constant k = 1 N/m, the required mass is

m = k

≈ 0.63 kg.

This corresponds to a cube of silicon with dimensions of

(cid:18) m

(cid:19)1/3 ≈ 6.5 cm,

L =

which is not very micromechanical. If the resonance frequency was f0 = 100 Hz,
the mass would be m = 2.5 µkg and the size of mass would be 1 mm3 – not
quite micron-sized but typical for bulk micromachined accelerometers.

3.2.3 Time domain response
The time domain response is critical in many accelerometer applications. Ide-
ally, the accelerometer output should follow the input (acceleration) instan-
taneously and without any error. However, as with any physical system, the
accelerometer output will lag the change in acceleration. The mechanical re-
sponse time is inversely related to the accelerometer resonance frequency ω0.
Moreover, the shape of the response depends on the damping: An under damped
system shows signiﬁcant overshoot and ringing and over damped systems are
slow to respond. In commercial applications, a well-behaved response without
ringing can be equally important as the fast response time. For example, in car
stability control, under damping in the feedback control loop could result in
oscillations with catastrophic consequences.

The step response describes the accelerometer response after a change in
acceleration. The step response is studied systematically in Appendix B and
we will summarize the results here. As shown in Figure 3.3, over damped ac-
celerometers are slow to respond. Under damped devices are fast but the step
response exhibits signiﬁcant overshoot and ringing. The optimal speed is ob-
tained with critical damping (Q = 0.5) that oﬀers the fastest step response
without overshoot or ringing.

In all cases, the displacement approaches the ﬁnal displacement xﬁnal = F/k.

The transient error decays approximately as

err = |x − xﬁnal| = e−t/τ

(3.7)

where τ is the time constant for the step response. From Appendix B, the time
constant for under damped system (Q > 0.5) is τu = 2Q/ω0 that describes
how quickly the oscillations decay. For a critically damped (Q = 0.5) and over
damped (Q < 0.5) systems, there is no closed form solution for the time con-
stant. The settling times for the critical damped system are tabulated in Ta-
ble B.1 on page 408. For over damped systems with Q < 0.2, the approximation
τo ≈ 1/ω0Q can be used.

settle to within 1% of the ﬁnal value?

step response and how quickly does the accelerometer settle to within 1% of

Solution: For over damped critically damped system with Q < 0.2, the time
constant is approximately

τ ≈ 1/ω0Q ≈ 80 µs.

which is almost ten times longer than for the critically damped accelerometer
in Example 3.3.

3.3 Damping

The damping is controlled by the gas pressure inside the accelerometer package.
The gas damping is covered in detail in Chapter 12 where the eﬀect of device
geometry and package pressure are analyzed. For now, it is suﬃcient to realize
that the accelerometer damping can be adjusted with the device design. Often
lowered package pressures are used to reduce the damping to an optimal level.
As shown in Figure 3.3, over damped accelerometers are slow to respond.
Under damped devices are fast but the step response exhibits signiﬁcant
overshoot and ringing. The optimal speed is obtained with critical damping
(Q = 0.5) that oﬀers the fastest step response without overshoot or ringing.

Practical limitations in device design may cause the actual damping to be
above or below the critical damping level. For example, real devices have mul-
tiple degrees of freedom and over damping may be used to suppress unwanted
vibration modes and resonances. Here the response speed is traded for greater
stability. Another extreme is the surface micromachined accelerometers that
are under damped. The gas damping is less signiﬁcant for laterally moving
structures and surface micromachined accelerometers which can have Q > 10
even at atmospheric pressure. The high quality factor results in ringing of the
proof mass that is not desired. To ﬁlter this ringing from the output signal,
the bandwidth of the surface micromachined accelerometers is typically limited
electrically to ω < ω0.

Example 3.5: Damping coeﬃcient
Problem: A micromachined accelerometer has the resonant frequency f0 =
2.0 kHz and the mass m = 0.5 nkg. If the desired quality factor is Q = 0.3,
what is the damping coeﬃcient?
Solution: The damping coeﬃcient is
γ = ω0m
Q

≈ 20.9 µkg/s.

3.4 Mechanical noise in accelerometers

The thermal noise induced mechanical vibrations set the lower limit for the
measurable acceleration. In Chapter 2, we learned that noise force generator
depends only on the dissipation and that small mechanical masses exhibit large
noise induced vibrations.

For the noise analysis, it is helpful to model the mechanical system as a
series connection of mass and spring as is shown in Figure 3.4. The mass m
converts the acceleration into a force that is converted to a displacement by the
spring k. The overall sensitivity A = x/¨x is

A = A1A2 = m

which is in agreement with Equation (3.5).

Equation (3.9) suggests that the noise could be reduced by increasing the
quality factor, increasing the mass, and reducing the resonant frequency ω0.
However, the beneﬁt of increasing the quality factor is purely superﬁcial. From
the equipartition theorem, we know that the total noise energy integrated

Equation (3.10) clearly shows that the quality factor does not aﬀect the total
input referred acceleration noise. In addition, the high-Q has the detrimental
eﬀect of increasing the step response time. Thus, increasing the proof mass and
lowering the resonant frequency are the only eﬀective methods to reduce the
mechanical noise. This partially explains why there are no “nanomechanical”
accelerometers on market.

Problem: A MEMS accelerometer has the mass m = 0.5 nkg and the me-

3.5 Commercial devices

To exemplify what we have learned, we will analyze two commercial microme-
chanical accelerometers. The ﬁrst device is a surface micromachined accelerom-
eter that has a relatively small mass. The second device is a bulk micromachined
accelerometer that has 104 times larger mass. By comparing the intrinsic noise
for the two accelerometers, it is clear that a large mass is needed for low noise.
The low intrinsic noise however, does not guarantee low overall noise. For the
analyzed devices, the overall sensor noise performance including the noise from
circuitry is an order of magnitude worse than the mechanical noise limit.

3.5.1 Case study: A surface micromachined accelerometer

Figure 3.6 shows a schematic for a surface micromachined accelerometer. The
structure and design parameters are similar to ADXL50 accelerometer from
Analog Devices [30–32]. The proof mass is suspended by folded spring beams
and moves in plane above the die surface. The proof mass motion relative to the
substrate is measured with ﬁxed sensing ﬁngers that are anchored to the sub-
strate. The capacitance measurement sensitivity is increased by measuring the
diﬀerential capacitance change C1− C2 between two electrodes. The diﬀerential
capacitive measurement is analyzed in detail in Chapter 6.
As the sensing element is relatively thin (∼2 µm), several sensing ﬁngers
are combined in parallel to increase the overall capacitance. Typical surface mi-
cromachine designs have 40-100 ﬁnger pairs but for illustrative purposes only
√
6 pairs are shown. Using the element values in Figure 3.6 and Equations (3.5)
and (3.9) we obtain x/¨x = 0.4 nm/G and ¨xn = 0.2 mG/
Hz for the ele-
ment sensitivity and noise, respectively. The intrinsic noise can be compared
to noise performance speciﬁcations of ¨xn = 1 mG/
Hz in manufacturer’s data
sheets [30]. The total noise including the measuring circuitry is a factor ﬁve
higher that the mechanical noise alone.

3.5.2 Case study: A bulk micromachined accelerometer

A typical bulk micromachined accelerometer is shown in Figure 3.7. The proof
mass moves in Z-direction in response to the Z-axis acceleration. The mass
displacement is detected by measuring the diﬀerential capacitance changes be-
tween the proof mass and the top and bottom electrodes.
Representative device dimensions for a bulk micromachined accelerometer
are 1 mm×1 mm×0.38 mm. The mass and spring constant are 1 · 10−6 kg
√
and 50 N/m, respectively. Using Equations (3.5) and (3.9), we obtain x/¨x =
0.2 µm/G and ¨xn = 3 µG/
Hz for the element sensitivity and noise, respec-
√
tively. The intrinsic noise can be compared to the noise performance speciﬁ-
cations of ¨xn = 20 µG/
Hz for a commercial accelerometer (SCA620 from

VTI Technologies [33]). We see that when noise from the measuring circuitry
is included, the total noise is a factor of eight larger than the mechanical noise
limit.

When comparing the surface and bulk micromachined accelerometers, it
is evident that the large mass of the bulk micromachined device enables lower
noise. In addition, the bulk micromachined accelerometer has a large sensitivity
which further increases signal-to-noise ratio. This need for high sensitivity will
be further investigated in Chapter 9 where the circuit noise is analyzed.

Key concepts

• Accelerometers consist of a proof mass and a spring. By measuring the
proof mass displacement relative to the frame, the acceleration can be
deduced.

• At low-frequencies (ω (cid:28) ω0), the inertial force F = m¨x is balanced by
the spring force F = kx. The accelerometer response x/¨x = m/k = 1/ω2
0
is inversely proportional to the resonance frequency squared.

• The mechanical noise sets the limit for the acceleration noise ﬂoor.
• The input referred noise equivalent acceleration spectral density is ¯¨xn =

m =
F n

mQ .

• The input referred noise equivalent rms-acceleration is ¨xrms =
0kBT
m .
• The system noise performance depends on both mechanical and electrical
noise. In commercial devices, the electrical noise is typically larger than
the fundamental mechanical noise limit.

Exercise 3.4
A capacitive accelerometer with 50 G full-scale acceleration is to have a max-
imum displacement of 1.5 µm. What is the lowest possible resonant frequency
for the accelerometer?

Exercise 3.5
A micromachined accelerometer has the resonant frequency f0 = 100 Hz and
the quality factor is Q = 0.2. What is the time constant for the step response
and how quickly the accelerometer settles to within 5% of the ﬁnal value?

Exercise 3.6
A micromachined accelerometer has the resonant frequency f0 = 100 Hz and
the mass m = 0.4 µkg. If the desired quality factor is Q = 0.2, what is the
damping coeﬃcient?

Exercise 3.7
Consider the commercial accelerometer in Figure 3.7. What is the smallest
√
proof mass size that could would lead to mechanical noise equal to the noise
performance speciﬁcations of ¨xn = 20 µG/
Hz in manufacturers data sheet?
Assume that the resonant frequency is constant (f0 = 1 kHz). Compare your
results to the estimated actual mass m = 1 µkg.

Exercise 3.8
√
The low-G accelerometer ADXL05 from Analog Devices has a pm5-G full scale
Hz (12× less than ADXL50). Assume
range and the noise ﬂoor is 500 µG/
that the characteristics of ADXL05 are identical to those given in Figure 3.6
except for k = 0.4 N/m and f0 = 10 kHz. Calculate the intrinsic acceleration
noise spectral density and sensor element sensitivity (displacement for a 1-G
acceleration). Compare numbers to ADXL50 in Figure 3.6.

Exercise 3.9
In this problem you are to explore noise in a micromachined accelerometer.
Figure 3.8 shows an accelerometer fabricated of SOI (silicon on insulator) wafer.
The plate dimensions are 200 µm × 200 µm × 10 µm and the silicon density is
2330 kg/m3. The spring constant is k = 0.08 N/m and damping coeﬃcient due
viscous air damping is γ = 4 µkg/s. What is the
a) sensor resonance frequency?
b) noise induced displacement spectral density below the resonance frequency?
c) proof mass rms-displacement due to noise?
√
d) noise equivalent acceleration spectral density?
e) How should the sensor be modiﬁed to obtain noise ﬂoor of 1 µG/
bandwidth is to remain constant?

view, Right: side view).
Exercise 3.10
Figure 3.9 shows how the total output noise can be reduced electronically with
a low pass ﬁlter. Although the total mechanical rms-noise is constant, we can
limit the mechanical noise at the electronics output by increasing quality factor
Q and low pass ﬁltering the measured signal. After ﬁltering, the total rms-noise
is ¨xrms = ¨xn
BW , where BW is the ﬁlter bandwisth. Investigate whether
this is a viable method make an accelerometer with performance “beyond noise
ﬂoor” (total noise less than the rms-noise given by Equation (3.10)). Hint: take
the sensitivity, the total thermal noise, and the settling time as the critical
parameters. Compare of the noise shaped accelerometer to that of critically
damped accelerometer that has same mass but smaller resonance frequency
corresponding to bandwidth of the ﬁltered accelerometer. Are there other fac-
tors that should be considered for fair judgment between the merits of electrical
vs. mechanical bandwidth limiting?

that the total measured rms-noise is less than xrms =
